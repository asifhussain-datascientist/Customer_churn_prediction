# Customer_churn_prediction
This repository contains a Customer Churn Prediction project, where machine learning models are used to identify customers who are likely to churn. The dataset is preprocessed, and multiple techniques are applied to improve model performance.

# Features of the Project
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset through visualizations and statistical insights.
* **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
* **Model Selection**: Training multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing one.
* **Cross-Validation**: Using Stratified K-Fold CV to ensure model generalization.
* **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Techniques such as downsampling are used to balance the dataset.
* **Overfitting Mitigation**: Regularization techniques and feature selection are applied to prevent overfitting.

# Improving Model Accuracy
To achieve the best accuracy, consider:

* **Implementing Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
* **Trying Different Model Selection Approaches**: Experiment with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
* **Applying Downsampling**: Balance the dataset to reduce bias.
* **Addressing Overfitting**: Use regularization techniques, feature selection, and dropout methods.
* **Using Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Ensure a balanced distribution of data across folds.
